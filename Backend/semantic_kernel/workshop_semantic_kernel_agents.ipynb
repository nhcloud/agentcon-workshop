    "\n",
    "**Semantic Kernel** provides a powerful framework for building AI agents with a plugin-based architecture. Let's understand the key components:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🏗️ Core Architecture Components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Kernel**: The central orchestrator that manages plugins, connectors, and execution context\n",
    "2. **Connectors**: Bridge between the kernel and various AI services (Azure OpenAI, Azure AI Foundry, Google, etc.)\n",
    "3. **Plugins**: Reusable skill sets that can be composed together for complex behaviors\n",
    "4. **Functions**: Individual atomic operations that can be native code or AI-powered prompts\n",
    "5. **Memory & Planning**: Advanced features for context retention and multi-step reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔄 Multi-Provider Support:\n",
    "\n",
    "Semantic Kernel excels at supporting multiple AI providers in a unified interface:\n",
    "- **Azure OpenAI**: Direct Azure OpenAI service integration\n",
    "- **Azure AI Foundry**: Enterprise-grade managed service with enhanced security\n",
    "- **Local Models**: Support for self-hosted models\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🛡️ Enterprise Features:\n",
    "- Managed identity integration\n",
    "- Token management and rate limiting\n",
    "- Plugin composition and chaining\n",
    "- Telemetry and observability\n",
    "- Security best practices\n",

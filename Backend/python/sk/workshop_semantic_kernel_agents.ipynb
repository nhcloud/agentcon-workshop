    "### Step 3: Upgrade pip\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install --upgrade pip\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "Welcome to the Semantic Kernel Agents Workshop! This hands-on tutorial will take you on an exciting journey from basic agent concepts to advanced multi-agent systems using Microsoft's Semantic Kernel framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You'll Build\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Generic Agent** - Start simple with a basic conversational agent\n",
    "2. **Azure AI Foundry Agent** - Level up with cloud-powered AI capabilities using Semantic Kernel\n",
    "3. **Group Chat System** - Master advanced multi-agent orchestration and collaboration\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Semantic Kernel?\n",
    "\n",
    "Semantic Kernel is Microsoft's framework that enables:\n",
    "- **Plugin Architecture**: Modular, extensible agent capabilities\n",
    "- **AI Orchestration**: Seamless integration with multiple AI services\n",
    "- **Function Calling**: Native integration with tools and APIs\n",
    "- **Memory Management**: Sophisticated conversation and context handling\n",
    "- **Enterprise Ready**: Built for production environments\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quick Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "This section sets up everything you need to run Semantic Kernel agents with minimal friction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start, ensure you have:\n",
    "- Python 3.8+ installed\n",
    "- Virtual environment activated (recommended)\n",
    "- Azure OpenAI endpoint and API key\n",
    "- Basic familiarity with async/await patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Path\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll progress from simple to advanced:\n",
    "1. **Foundation**: Basic Semantic Kernel setup and simple agents\n",
    "2. **Evolution**: Adaptive agents with memory and learning\n",
    "3. **Orchestration**: Multi-agent systems with specialized roles\n",
    "4. **Mastery**: Production-ready collaborative AI systems\n",

    "### How Group Chat Works:\n",
    "1. **User poses a question** - You ask a complex question that might benefit from multiple perspectives\n",
    "2. **Orchestrator analyzes** - The orchestrator determines which agents are most relevant\n",
    "3. **Agents collaborate** - Multiple agents contribute their expertise to the discussion\n",
    "4. **Synthesized response** - The orchestrator combines insights into a comprehensive answer\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Scenarios:\n",
    "- **Product Launch Strategy**: Business expert handles market analysis, creative expert designs marketing, tech expert addresses technical requirements\n",
    "- **Website Development**: Tech expert handles architecture, creative expert designs UI/UX, business expert considers user needs\n",
    "- **Problem Solving**: Multiple perspectives lead to more comprehensive solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach mimics real-world collaboration where different experts contribute their specialized knowledge!"

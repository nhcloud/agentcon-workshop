    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Create Virtual Environment\n",
    "From the **root folder** of this repository, run:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python -m venv .venv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Activate Virtual Environment\n",
    "- **Windows**: `.venv\\Scripts\\activate`\n",
    "- **macOS/Linux**: `source .venv/bin/activate`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Create .env Configuration File\n",
    "Create a `.env` file in this directory (or the parent directory) with your Azure OpenAI credentials:\n",

    "**Important:** Never commit your `.env` file to version control! Add it to `.gitignore`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Select Virtual Environment in VS Code\n",
    "1. Click on the **kernel selector** in the top-right corner of this notebook\n",
    "2. Select **\"Select Another Kernel...\"**\n",

    "## Integration with Python API Backend\n",
    "\n",
    "This workshop connects with the actual Python Semantic Kernel API backend. The agents you've created here follow the same patterns used in the production API.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Integration Points:\n",
    "1. **Agent Architecture** - Uses the same agent classes as the backend API\n",
    "2. **Group Chat System** - Implements the HybridSemanticKernelRouter for multi-agent coordination  \n",
    "3. **Azure Integration** - Same Azure OpenAI and Azure AI Foundry setup as the API\n",
    "4. **Session Management** - Compatible session and agent registry patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "### Production Features Available:\n",
    "- **REST API Endpoints** - `/group-chat` for multi-agent conversations\n",
    "- **Agent Registry** - Dynamic agent management and selection\n",
    "- **Session Management** - Persistent conversation history\n",
    "- **Error Handling** - Robust error handling and logging\n",
    "\n",
    "### Try the API:\n",
    "You can test the running API backend at `http://localhost:8001` (if running) with endpoints like:\n",
    "- `GET /health` - Check system health\n",
    "- `GET /agents` - List available agents  \n",
    "- `POST /group-chat` - Start multi-agent conversations\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook agents you've created demonstrate the core capabilities that power the full API system!"
